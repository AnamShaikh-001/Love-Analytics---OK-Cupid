# OK Cupid - "Love Analytics: Unveiling Insights in the World of Online Dating"	

## Problem Statement

Humans are usually classified as a 'Social Animal'.
This emphasizes our natural inclination and ability to form social connections, interact with others, and engage in cooperative behaviors.
One such meaninful social connection or relation is - Love, something everyone is looking for. In this day and age where everyone is busy is their own rat race, it can often get very challenging to find such a connection.
But, as humans we don't like to give up on any prospect, so we came up with - Online Dating Platforms.

In the digital age, online dating platforms have become increasingly popular avenues for individuals to seek companionship and romantic connections. However, with the vast amount of data generated by these platforms, there exists a tremendous opportunity to gain valuable insights into user behaviors, preferences, and trends.

The objective of this project, "Love Analytics: Unveiling Insights in the World of Online Dating," is to leverage the power of data analytics using Power BI to uncover actionable insights that can enhance user experiences, optimize matchmaking algorithms, and improve overall platform performance.

The dashboard helps the platform to understand their users better. It helps them understand the preffernce of the users. Through different information procured from the data, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. It also helps them derive meaninful insights and come up with valuable business solutions to increase their user base and make the user experience even better.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load the data procured from Kaggle onto a Jupyter Notebook
- Step 2 : Perform extensive EDA and pre-processing on the data
- Step 3 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file which is now cleaned and ready to use.
- Step 4 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section and take a look at the data loaded.
- Step 5 : Perform some basic faeture engineering like creating new columns from existing ones.
- Step 6 : Create a dashboard with meaningful graphs and statistical approaches.
- Step 7 : Add cards and other feaures available on PowerBI to make the dashboard more visually appealing and interactive.
- Step 8 : Derive meaningful insights and provide valuable Business solutions.

In our dataset, there were some discrepancies and annomalies which we had to fix before any analysis was done.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
       
       Number of People :
       No. of people = count(Sheet1[activity_status])

       Target Population :
       Target_population = 
                 CALCULATE(
                COUNTROWS('Sheet1'),
                FILTER(
                       'Sheet1',
                       'Sheet1'[activity_status] = 0 
                     )
         )

# Insights

A two page report was created on Power BI Desktop

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Total Number of Users = 41819

   Number of Males = 25168 (60.18 %)

   Number of Female = 16651 (39.82 %)

   Number of Active People = 1492


           thus, higher number of males than females are observed.
           
### [2] Age

-   The age ranges between 18 - 69, with majority of them being between 25 - 35 years of age

- 12244 people out of 41819 belong to the age 25, which is the maximum number of people on this application

- The least people belong to the age group 18-19 and 65 - 69

           thus, we need to focus more on the age group between 18-19.
  
### [3] Sex
  
- Out of 41819 people 25.17k (60.18%) are males

- and, 16.65k (39.81%) are females

          thus, we need to look for ways to attract the female population.

 ### [4] Status

- 40289(96.34%) people are single, 1328(3.18%) are seeing someone, and 198(0.3%) are married, while the rest are unknown

         thus, our main focus would be the single people.
 
 ### [5] Orientation
 
- There are 3 types of orientations targeted in this dataset ---> straight, gay and bisexual

- Out of these the maximum users belong to the straight category (84.6%), while the rest are either gay or bisexual.

          thus, we can look into measures to make the application more Queer friendly
 
 ### [6] Body Types
 
- Most of the people, both in males and females belong to the fit category(13701 males and 6087 females)

- The rest belong to body types ranging from skinny to overweight.
         
### [7] Education

- Most of the people are graduated both in males and female

### [8] Drinks 

- Most of the people take drinks socially 

### [9] Drugs 
MosT of the people never take drugs

### [10] Location
Most people belong to San Francisco, California

## Business Insigts :
- Our main target population are the single population who show the activity status (last seen) of 0 days ag0. 

- We also need to focus on the younger age group falling between 18-20 as we observe less number of users from that category

- The female population on the application is drastically lower than the male population, which means we need to cater more to their needs

- Large number of people belong to metropolitan cities compared to rural cities, so we need to improvise in this category as well

- The people who have the last seen of more than 50 days ago need to be kept engaged on the application

- Since there is a huge chunk of people who drink socially we can have collaborations with places that serve alcohol to make the user base more interactive
